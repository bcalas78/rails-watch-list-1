This project is a web app where customers can create watch-list with their favorite movies and can comment the lists of the other customers.

The app diplays:

- Log-in - the user has to log-in to access more features.
- A home-page with links to go to the lists of movies.
- A list of movies page - the customers can see all the lists that already exist and create their owns.
- A create watch-list page - the customers have to add a title, a photo and choose the movies they want to add in the list. They have to add a comment for each movie.
- A list page - Customers can see the details of each list and add a comment and a rating for the list in the comment section.

Watch List 1 is a personal project, I worked on it by myself after the Le Wagon bootcamp.

Skills: RAILS / RUBY / JS / HTML / CSS.
